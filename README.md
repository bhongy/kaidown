## Todo

focus on dev story for now

[ ] Run completely in Docker
[ ] yarn.lock change causes Docker image rebuild / container restart
[ ] Typescript node server (auto-compile in Docker)
[ ] Auto-restart server on code change (HMR is a plus, if I can figure it out)
    code change doesn't restart container - but restart the server
[ ] JIT Webpack compilation each web page (server request) - webpack only to create client bundles
[ ]
